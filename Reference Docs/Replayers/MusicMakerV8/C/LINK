;
; EXAMPLE for calling the Linker for a C program to play MusicMaker-Music
;
; c-player.o is the compiled "C-Player.c" from this disk,
;
; c-interface.o contains the stack-to-register conversion routines required
;               for c-programs. (Same file for sysplayer as well as mplayer!)
; sysplayer.o   contains the MusicMaker 4-channel player code,
; mplayer.o     contains the MusicMaker 8-channel player code.
;
; tw#?song#? are the files containing the sound data; they are created by
;          MusicMaker's "O"-command from CM.
;
; mmv8.lib, mmv88.lib, mmvx.lib are required for using the libraries
;
;
blink lib:c.o
      MMV8:Developer/C/C-Player.o              ; 4-channels
      MMV8:Developer/C/C-Interface.o
      MMV8:Developer/linkmodules/sysplayer.o
      obj:twsong.s.o       ; any 4-channel song
      obj:twsong.i.o
   TO MMV8:Developer/C/C-Player
  LIB lib:lc.lib+lib:amiga.lib+lib:mmv8.lib

blink lib:c.o
      MMV8:Developer/C/C-8Player.o             ; 8-channels
      MMV8:Developer/C/C-Interface.o
      MMV8:Developer/linkmodules/mplayer.o
      obj:tw1song.s.o      ; any 8-channel song
      obj:tw1song.i.o
   TO MMV8:Developer/C/C-8Player
  LIB lib:lc.lib+lib:amiga.lib+lib:mmv88.lib


; If you are using the mmv8.library instead (without) linking the player code
; to your program, that's what it says:
blink lib:c.o
      MMV8:Developer/C/C-player.o
      obj:twsong.s.o
      obj:twsong.i.o
   TO MMV8:Developer/C/C-player
  LIB lib:lc.lib+lib:amiga.lib+MMV8:Developer/C/MMV8.lib

; Note: THESE C-Player examples both use the library (LIB-File required)
; AND need the sys|mplayer.o !
