# Faulty/damaged files (MD5 hash and filename)


#### The Adventures of Quik & Silva

Music data file (size 7875) is one byte too short (missing a 0x9C at the end) and thus is corrupting the
last sound macro offset. As a result, an instrument is not played. Only obvious,
if you know these ingame tunes.

#### Apidya loader

Header has been invalidated with a flood of 0x0d values, which breaks
all TFMX players that expect the space character after the "TFMX-SONG" tag.
The structure's two fields about compression have become invalid, too.
The sample data possibly are shifted by four bytes, which causes clearly
audible clicks:

```
 f46a01e4eae101d79af636a5b9015684  Apidya - Load.tfx

#### Wings of Death ST

The Atari ST to Amiga conversion of ``Wings of Death`` as found on the
Wanted Team page of example files raises doubts. It is prepended with
the original machine code player from Wings of Death on Amiga, which is
not the right one to replay it, because higher Amiga Paula frequencies are
needed than what is supported by the array of periods within that player.
Furthermore, compared with the original Atari ST music data, the
sequencer's track table has been modified to transpose some patters by
three octaves, which sounds bad:

```
 0a2da84b25a5fd128f50f773a0739378  SOG.WingsOfDeathST intro
 SOG_WingsOfDeathST.lzx (218914 bytes) - all modules from the game "Wings Of Death" (Atari ST version).
```

While looking into it and discussing it, the author of that file suddenly
reverted the transposition. The resulting file is exactly the Atari ST music
data except for sample data converted from unsigned to signed. There is special
support for the repaired file in libtfmxaudiodecoder **newer than 1.0.1** to
play it without sounding bad. The repaired file's MD5 fingerprint is:

```
 58c5a79885c1068e3e11e077491f0b1c  SOG.WingsOfDeathST intro_repaired
```

#### Grand Monster Slam ST

The Atari ST to Amiga conversion of ``Grand Monster Slam`` as found on the
Wanted Team page of example files plays one PING sound in a loop, which
leads to a few erratic sounds during playback, and which is wrong compared
with Chris Hülsbeck's original melody. Examining the Atari ST data, actually
three samples with length null are meant to be played in one-shot mode.

```
 5051058f1d0d77db04bf86d65ebf738b  SOG.GrandSlamMonsterST
```

There is special support for that file in libtfmxaudiodecoder **newer than 1.0.1**,
which fixes the PING and the two other sounds on-the-fly while loading the music file. If
reparing the file, its MD5 fingerprint becomes:

```
 3e44767bb77e309a328edcb482ee51b2  SOG.GrandMonsterSlamST_repaired
```

#### Future Composer modules

 * The soundtrack modules from the game ``Chambers of Shaolin`` as included
with Future Composer v1.2 and v1.3 in SMOD format are broken (since their
conversion from TFMX has introduced mistakes), but have been copied into
many module collections. Repaired files have been merged at [Modland](https://modland.com/pub/modules/Future%20Composer%201.3/Jochen%20Hippel/).
Alternatively prefer the original soundtrack in Hippel's TFMX format.

 * ``wassermu.hipc`` (short for Wassermusik) in compressed TFMX format
raises doubts. It is Chambers of Shaolin "ingame 1" aka "Test of Balance",
but with some added/restored patterns playing on voice 4. Strangely, one
of the instruments is broken compared with the original TFMX version (and
also the FC conversion).

 * ``Dreamcave.hipc`` with missing sample data in some module collections
is a duplicate of ``Amberstar (12).hipc``. Sometimes the samples are found
in a separate file named "hipc.samp", in other cases the separate file is
named "smp.set" but is stored in a different path. Searching for it and
loading it would not be worthwhile. Especially not since it is a duplicate.
